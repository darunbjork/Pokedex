# Pokedex
 This is a simple web application, that's been built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 it allows users to open and close Pokemons by clicking the button.


 This is my first project and first time interacting with JavaScript, so it was quite challenging to create a well-structured web application.
 Throughout this app learning(Achievment 1), I learnt how powerful and crucial JavaScript is, to make an application function.
